		<p>Hi again. My name is Erfan Qasemizade but I use the nickname frustak.</p>
		<p>
			I mainly work as a front-end developer but I think of myself as a more general, software
			engineer kind.
		</p>
		<p>
			Creating fun stuff is my passion and coding is a great way to build things without much cost.
			And of course I love the open-source (YAY).
		</p>
		<p>Oh by the way, I like cyberpunk stuff and cats üê± even though I never had one.</p>
	</div>
